## 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm an AI Engineer with a strong foundation in Machine Learning, NLP, LLMs, AI Agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I design and build intelligent systems — from RAG pipelines and autonomous agents to scalable, production-ready ML solutions. My work focuses on combining retrieval, reasoning, and automation to deliver real-world value.

I enjoy end-to-end AI engineering: model development, multi-step reasoning agents, data processing pipelines, experimentation, deployment, and MLOps. I'm continuously expanding my expertise through hands-on projects in deep learning, MLOps, and generative AI.
